    "### About Gradient boost\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting refers to a class of ensemble machine learning algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is also known as gradient tree boosting, stochastic gradient boosting (an extension), and gradient boosting machines, or GBM for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembles are constructed from decision tree models. Trees are added one at a time to the ensemble and fit to correct the prediction errors made by prior models. This is a type of ensemble machine learning model referred to as boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are fit using any arbitrary differentiable loss function and gradient descent optimization algorithm. This gives the technique its name, “gradient boosting,” as the loss gradient is minimized as the model is fit, much like a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is an effective machine learning algorithm and is often the main, or one of the main, algorithms used to win machine learning competitions (like Kaggle) on tabular and similar structured datasets."

    "## AdaBoost Algorithm - Ensemble learning\n",
    "Ada-boost or Adaptive Boosting is one of ensemble boosting classifier proposed by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1996. It combines multiple classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers. AdaBoost is an iterative ensemble method. AdaBoost classifier builds a strong classifier by combining multiple poorly performing classifiers so that you will get high accuracy strong classifier. The basic concept behind Adaboost is to set the weights of classifiers and training the data sample in each iteration such that it ensures the accurate predictions of unusual observations. Any machine learning algorithm can be used as base classifier if it accepts weights on the training set. Adaboost should meet two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier should be trained interactively on various weighed training examples.\n",
    "In each iteration, it tries to provide an excellent fit for these examples by minimizing training error."
